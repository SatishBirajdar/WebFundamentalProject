			The 250 GTO was the ultimate expression of the Ferrari 250 GT car. It was equally at home on the road or track perhaps the last dual purpose road/race car produced and has achieved legendary status amongst aficionados of the marque. 	</div>
		<div class="para2">
			With only a relatively small production run of thirty six cars, and with many of the examples produced having a great race pedigree, it has become one of the icons of Ferrari production history, with a revered position in collector's circles. It is arguably the best sports car ever made, and one could say that a vehicle with such a prestigious history and status is priceless. Own a part of racing history today with the Ferrari 250 GTO.
