			During its heyday this Gran Turismo (GT) dominated the World Manufacturer's Championship and events like the 24 Hours of Le Mans with a newly designed body that could go 180 mph. With form following function, this efficient shape was inadvertently one of the most voluptuous to grace a Ferrari chassis.

			<div class="para2">
			At this level of performance, style and pedigree, it shouldn't be surprising that the 250 GTO is currently one of the most expensive cars in the world. Chassis 3729GT received a high bid of nine million dollars at Bonhams' 1997 Gstaad Auction, but since it failed to meet the reserve, the model has been exclusively sold on the private market. No one really knows the highest price that has been paid for a GTO, but we estimate $30,000,000 USD is a realistic value in 2012.
